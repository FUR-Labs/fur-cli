# Quantum Entanglement: Cinematic Style ðŸŽ¬

Two photons, light-years apart,  
yet whispering secrets faster than light.  

They move like dancers in the void â€”  
one step taken here,  
answered instantly there.  

Itâ€™s not science fiction.  
Itâ€™s the weirdest reality we know.  

*"Entanglement is love written in physics."*
