## Market Problem  
Classical encryption is under siege from quantum attacks.  
Data is fragile, trust is scarce, and the future is uncertain.  

---

## Solution  
- **QKD Networks:** Unhackable global communication  
- **Quantum Mesh Cloud:** Share entangled qubits on demand  
- **Scalable APIs:** Make quantum security developer-friendly  

---

## Closing Line  
Invest in the **sex appeal of physics** turned into infrastructure.  
The future isnâ€™t binary.  
Itâ€™s entangled.
